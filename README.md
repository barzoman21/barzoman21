- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @barzoman21, gonna turn 18 soon. It might be a little late age to be still doing simple calculators and converters. I'll say terms and no other excuses.
 Iâ€™m interested in anything technologic, specifically into well-made/thought-on video games, have been playing a lot of games since a young young age. 
 Love playing through and reading through well-written scripts/books/games and all.
 Iâ€™m currently learning Python and will definitely try creating something on Unity. Would also love to try out it Unreal Engine but I think it'd be hard with the processor i have.
I've had this account for a while now, but decided to fill it with simple but hardworked and personalized (as much as I can) projects. I understand the
importance of creating a portfolio online. That could also be considered as the starting baby steps of my so called career :P
